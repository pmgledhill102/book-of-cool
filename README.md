Some of my favourite shiny things

## API Tools

- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). A great OpenSource REST Client, and slim version of the now bloated Postman.

## WinGet

I've been a fan of automated Workstation builds for years, those who know me will remember the
PupBoot builds of the early 2000s. Technology moves on, and finally Microsoft have introduced
a package manager for Windows called WinGet. This is fantastic. It allows for a single line install
of almost every imaginable app. Coupled with similar installers for VSCode plug-ins, and my Windows
reinstalls are 95% automated.

I've included a recent copy of my build script, which is pretty self explanatory: [win-apps-installer.cmd](src/win-apps-installer.cmd)

## GraphQL

Great API interaction standard

- Main GraphQL Page: <https://graphql.org/>

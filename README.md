## WinGet

I've been a fan of automated Workstation builds for years, those who know me will remember the
PupBoot builds of the early 2000s. Technology moves on, and finally Microsoft have introduced
a package manager for Windows called WinGet. This is fantastic. It allows for a single line install
of almost every imaginable app. Coupled with similar installers for VSCode plug-ins, and my Windows
reinstalls are 95% automated.

Some of my favourite shiny things
